React Native 0.64 is out! Which means it's time to showcase all the work we've put in around supporting more community modules, TurboModules, APIs improvements, and even some tools, all in the effort to improve the developer experience.

<!--truncate-->

There's been a lot of work on improving the developer experience, as that's been a focus for us as a whole across all our frameworks and platforms, and React Native for Windows is no exception! Through tooling, dogfooding our own work, and "under the hood" improvements, we're looking forward to sharing with you some of the highlights in this release that we're especially proud to announce.

# React Native Gallery App
As part of our growing effort to improve the APIs, developer experience, and end-to-end story of developing React Native apps for Windows, we've decided to build and ship our own app, called the [React Native Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-gallery).

The app's main purpose is to showcase all the current functionality available in React Native for Windows, while also being a way for us to test cross-platform community modules and keep ourselves honest about the process of pushing an app to the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/windows).

Much like the [XAML Controls Gallery](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt) for WinUI, we intend to have the React Native Gallery be available not only as a proving ground for our own work, but also a place where native and JavaScript components alike can be seen in action in the Windows ecosystem. This includes providing lightweight code snippets on each page for developers to copy out and use in their own scenarios.

## Try it out now!
To get your hands on a copy of the app while we wait for final Store approval, head on over to the repo and check out the [certified install on our 0.64 branch](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-gallery/tree/v0.64.0-preview.5/windows/rngallery_1.0.2.0_Win32_Test).

Alternately, you can get the latest state of the app and the source to test things out directly on our [main repo branch](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-gallery).

# üìö Growing Windows community module support

Over the last couple of months, the team has made a concerted effort to increase the number of modules that target React Native for Windows. We know that modules are an important part of React Native ecosystem, so we are excited to share that we‚Äôve added Windows implementations for several modules, including:

- [react-native-tts](https://github.com/ak1394/react-native-tts)
- [react-native-codepush](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push)
- [react-native-sketch-canvas](https://github.com/creambyemute/react-native-sketch-canvas)
- [react-native-pdf](https://github.com/wonday/react-native-pdf)
- [react-native-print](https://github.com/christopherdro/react-native-print)
- [react-native-device-info](https://github.com/react-native-device-info/react-native-device-info)
- [react-native-orientation-locker](https://github.com/wonday/react-native-orientation-locker)
- [rn-fetch-blob](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob) ([module unmaintained](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob/issues/666), but [Windows code in PR](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob/pull/701))
- [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) ([in PR](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen/pull/514))

‚Ä¶ and more are coming! You can see which modules we‚Äôre tracking on the [Community Module Requests project board.](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/projects/23)

In addition to the modules that we have recently worked on, you can view and search the complete list of modules that work with Windows by visiting [reactnative.directory](https://reactnative.directory/). The directory catalogues modules that work on the major platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS and provides metrics around usage, popularity, and more.

You can also check out the [react-native-gallery repo](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-gallery) to see some of the modules ‚Äúin action‚Äù. We‚Äôre using the Gallery as a testbed to verify and showcase modules that work with Windows ‚Äì we‚Äôre adding new samples over time, so check back often!

## A module I need doesn't work with Windows yet!

Fret not! We‚Äôre continually reassessing and reviewing the set of modules that are important to React Native for Windows devs, so if you need a module that doesn‚Äôt yet have a Windows implementation, please [open a new issue on the React Native for Windows GitHub repo.](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/new/choose)

If you have experience writing Windows native code, you can also use the [new Community module template workflow](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/native-modules-setup) to create a module template for Windows. This is a great way to start using native Windows APIs quickly in custom modules.

## Janea Systems

Finally, we wanted to highlight our partnership with [Janea Systems](http://www.janeasystems.com/), who has helped provide implementation, consultation, and support for many of the modules listed above. In particular, we wanted to shout out to [@jaimecbernardo](https://github.com/jaimecbernardo), [@joaocgreis](https://github.com/joaocgreis), and [@bzoz](https://github.com/bzoz) from Jeana Systems for their help over the last few months.

# React Native for macOS
Community Work

- React-Native-Community macOS ProgressView support
- React-Native-Community macOS Clipboard support
- React-Native-Community macOS SVG Icon support
- We can‚Äôt check this in because the repo owner has to merge it and he is just one person who is ‚Äútaking a break‚Äù from OSS, but it‚Äôs up and running in our fork.
We‚Äôre setting up the npm publishing CI this week for macOS

- macOS keyboarding events support
- macOS Tooltip support for Button, Text, Image, Slider, and TextInput
This is out for review now but will get checked in tomorrow

# TurboModules

We've added support for C++ JSI TurboModules as they exist today in React Native core projects. You won't have to worry about writing any code differently from how you do today in React Native, but when you run your app on Windows, we will ensure it works over the ABI-safe boundaries. This means your React Native Windows TurboModules can be shipped in different DLLs and we take care of the binary compatibility between versions.

This feature is still considered experimental in 0.64, because it is not finished in React Native Core. Meaning we may need to change the ABI surface in future releases.

# Developer Goodness
As with many of our releases, there's always a number of developer and "under the covers" upgrades we make to the framework as a whole. These usually includes things like performance improvements, better API parity and of course general bug fixes, but let's take a look at some of the notable items available this release.

## Easy opt-in to Hermes

Performance is a huge deal when developing in general, but especially so when it comes to using React Native. We're pretty invested is using Hermes and while there are teams using it in production, support is still experimental and we do not have the full Hermes debugger or Hermes in C# capabilities online yet. We would still love to know if you try Hermes and run into any issues, so go ahead and [give it a try today!]((https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/hermes))

## More API parity

More component properties supported by the other platforms now work on Windows! These include Text's `backgroundColor`, `border`, and `textTransform`, as well as `Platform.version` and an initial version of `AccessibilityInfo` are now available.

To get the full list of release details, including breaking changes, check out our [release notes over on our repo.](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/releases/tag/react-native-windows_v0.64.0-preview.1)

## Get the goodness
The best way to upgrade from 0.62 or 0.63 to this latest **0.64** release is to:
- Create a brand new blank 0.64 using `react-native-windows-init`
- Copy over the content of your older versions project

Moving forward we are looking to provide a diff tool to help make this easier, this tool would operate similarly to `react-native-upgrade-helper`.
